Instructions for installing the environment and conda:

1. Create interactive job: 'si --time=02:00:00 -c 7'

2. Use 'source install_conda.sh' to install miniconda in your HOME directory (only use this ONCE)

3. Use './create_environment.sh' to create the environment

IMPORTANT: If you did not use 'source' but './' in the 2. step you have to
execute the last 3 commands by yourself in the CLI
