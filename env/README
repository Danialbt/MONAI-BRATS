Instructions for installing the environment and conda:

1. Create interactive job: 'si --time=02:00:00 -c 7'

2. Use './install_conda.sh' to install miniconda in your HOME directory

3. Use './create_environment.sh' to create the environment

IMPORTANT: If you installed the environment with the earlier version of this example and an
error is thrown when executing the brats_train_hpc.sh or brats_deploy_hpc.sh ("module monai not found")
just execute step 1+2 again

If you want to remove conda at some point first execute 'conda init --reverse' and afterwards remove the
miniconda folder in the HOME directory
